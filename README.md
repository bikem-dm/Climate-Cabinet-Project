# Climate-Cabinet-Project
The main aim of the project is to test the working condition of the test items at certain temperatures through a climate cabinet and to facilitate the test process. In this way it is determined at which temperatures the test items cannot function or at which temperatures they function most effectively.

####  Languages & Technologies
While we coded the presentation layer of the project with Swing, we also used Java in the business layer and data layer. We used phpMyAdmin technology and MySQL language during database creation and connection to the project. By taking commands from the server to the machine with mock data, we ensured that the machine stays in communication with the data it received from the client.
